        "This function resizes images to a specified target size without affecting the aspect ratio. This step is due to the successive batching of all images that requires a common format for all of them.\n",

        "For what regards data augmentation and the splitting of the data into two distinct sets, namely train and validation, it has been used the following script which assigns a fraction of 30% of the imgaes to the validation set; the rest will be assigned to the training set.\n",
